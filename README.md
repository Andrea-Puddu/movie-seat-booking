## Udemy Course

I made this project at online course [Build 20 mini frontend projects from scratch with HTML5, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) by Brad Traversy.

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- User can select a movie/price
- User can select/deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh
